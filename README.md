The Telex Interview Bot is an integration designed to automate the initial candidate screening process within the Telex platform. It will function as an interactive bot that conducts structured interviews, collects candidate responses, and forwards the results to an HR representative for review. This integration aims to streamline recruitment workflows, improve efficiency, and reduce the manual workload for hiring teams.
